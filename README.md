## General info
This simple program will allow you to install all your stellaris mods from the .zip file without the hassle of unzipping it one-by-one, moving its descriptor file, renaming it etc.

## Installation
Download the python file or paste the raw code into a .py file in to the folder where all your Stellaris .zip files are located, and launch the script using
```
$ python3 stellaris-mod-installer.py
```
Note that the program will set the path to the current folder (where the .py file is located) and will set all the descriptors path by that.
